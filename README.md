# FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: MEGANATHAN S

*INTERN ID*: CT12DN552

*DOMAIN*: JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 12 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

### Description of Task 1

The objective of *Task 1* was to design and develop a *File Handling Utility* using *Java* that allows users to perform basic operations such as writing, reading, and modifying data in a text file. This utility was built as part of the *CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS Front-End Development Internship, under the guidance of mentor **Neela Santosh*.

To develop this application, I used *Visual Studio Code (VS Code)* as my primary code editor due to its user-friendly interface, IntelliSense support, and excellent Java development tools integration. I configured the Java Development Kit (JDK) in VS Code, along with required extensions for Java (such as the Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat and Debugger for Java).

### Tools and Technologies Used:

* *Programming Language*: Java (Core Java concepts)
* *Editor*: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* *Compiler/Runtime*: Java Development Kit (JDK 17)
* *Operating System*: Windows 10
* *Concepts Used*:

  * File handling (FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader)
  * Exception handling (try-catch)
  * User input handling (Scanner)
  * Loops and conditional statements

### Functionality Implemented:

This File Handling Utility presents a menu-driven console interface where the user can:

1. *Write to File* – Takes text input from the user and writes it to a file named data.txt.
2. *Read from File* – Reads the contents of the file and displays it line by line.
3. *Modify File Content* – Overwrites existing content with new input.
4. *Exit* – Ends the application safely.

### Purpose and Application:

This task demonstrates practical knowledge of Java’s file I/O operations, which are essential in many real-world applications such as:

* Logging systems
* Storing application settings
* Note-taking or personal organizer tools
* Data export tools
* Feedback or comment systems

This utility can be extended into larger systems that require file-based data interaction, like simple databases, report generators, or configuration editors.

### Challenges Faced:

One of the main challenges I faced was designing a user-friendly structure for repeated interaction in the console. Initially, I wrote the code using multiple static methods without organizing the logic clearly, which made debugging and testing difficult. I had to restructure the flow to ensure the menu was clean, reusable, and allowed easy navigation for the user. Another challenge was ensuring the program didn’t crash due to invalid inputs like letters where numbers were expected—this required careful input validation and exception handling.

### Learning Outcomes:

* Gained a solid understanding of Java I/O and user input handling.
* Improved logical thinking while designing a menu-based program.
* Learned better organization of code using methods and proper naming conventions.
* Developed skills in testing and debugging console applications.
* Learned to use Visual Studio Code effectively with Java support.

In conclusion, Task 1 gave me hands-on experience in building a utility that handles files in Java. It strengthened my basic programming skills, improved my ability to handle real-world user interactions, and made me more confident in structuring clean, maintainable code for Java applications.
